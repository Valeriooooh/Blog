It&amp;rsquo;s modes are incredibly versatile and never cease to amaze me.
Some days ago I found myself in a conundrum, my Emacs config only supported one dictionary at a time.
Dictionary Plugins This dictionary plugins are really a life saver because they &amp;ldquo;lint&amp;rdquo; your text and help you find other words that are similar to the one you wrote incorrectly. Things that other code editors don&amp;rsquo;t have for writing $\LaTeX$ or Markdown
This is very frustrating if you write school papers/essays in your home language and write something in other language.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://valeriooooh.github.io/post/first-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:27:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://valeriooooh.github.io/post/first-blog/</guid><description>Hello there This is the first post of this blog and I would like to present myself:
