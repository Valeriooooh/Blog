# Hello there
This is the first post of this blog and I would like to present myself:

- My name is Diogo Val√©rio

- I'm a first year Computer Science student 

- I live in Portugal

- I'm a hobbyist programmer

Some programming languages that have caught my interest recently were [rust](http://rust-lang.org) and [Haskell](http://haskell.org).
I'm very into functional programming. I've also messed a little with [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org).

I'm a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) power user and a [FOSS](https://opensource.org/) advocate. 

I'm also a PC gamer and I'm interested in **Game Development**.
