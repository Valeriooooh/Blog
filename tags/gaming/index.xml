My name is Diogo Valério
I&amp;rsquo;m a first year Computer Science student
I live in Portugal
I&amp;rsquo;m a hobbyist programmer
Some programming languages that have caught my interest recently were rust and Haskell. I&amp;rsquo;m very into functional programming. I&amp;rsquo;ve also messed a little with lisp and Clojure.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Linux power user and a FOSS advocate.
I&amp;rsquo;m also a PC gamer and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in Game Development.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://valerio-blog.netlify.app/post/first-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:27:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://valerio-blog.netlify.app/post/first-blog/</guid><description>Hello there This is the first post of this blog and I would like to present myself:
